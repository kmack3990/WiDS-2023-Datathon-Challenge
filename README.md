# WiDS-2023-Datathon-Challenge
Three BrainStation alumni and I have formed a team to tackle the 2023 Women in Data Science (WiDS) Datathon.  The first installment in this repository is my data processing, EDA, and initial modeling attempt.  Notebook 1 is a strong start, but there is much work to be done to move up the leaderboard in this challenge.  Notebook 2 will be added in the coming weeks.
